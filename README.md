# spatialkernel

An R package for nonparametric estimation of spatial segregation in a multivariate point process. Contains functionality for edge-corrected kernel density estimation and binary kernel regression estimation for multivariate spatial point process data.

The original spatialkernel package has been archived from CRAN. This version
fixes failing checks, with the intention of having it restored to CRAN.

## Installation

You can install spatialkernel from github with:

``` r
